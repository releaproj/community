# Community
ReleaProj community for discussion about anything related to ReleaProj products
## An IMPORTANT rule!
- Do NOT open discussion about off-topic things such as questions about BeagleEditor or other topics. If you're looking for discussions about BeagleSoftware products (for example, BeagleEditor or Paytory), go to [BeagleSoftware community repo discussion](https://github.com/beaglesoftware/community/discussions) and if you have any question not related to BeagleSoftware or ReleaProj, don't do anything
